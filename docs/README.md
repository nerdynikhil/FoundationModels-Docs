## üåü Key Features

- **Native Swift Integration** - First-class Swift API with async/await support
- **Structured Generation** - Type-safe AI outputs with compile-time validation  
- **Real-time Streaming** - Responsive UIs with live content generation
- **Extensible Tools** - Custom AI capabilities through the Tool protocol

- **Privacy-First** - On-device processing with optional cloud fallback

## üéØ What Makes This API Special

Apple's Foundation Models API represents a paradigm shift in mobile AI development:

1. **Type Safety**: Unlike traditional text-based APIs, Foundation Models provides compile-time validation for AI-generated content
2. **Streaming Architecture**: Built from the ground up for real-time, responsive user experiences
3. **Declarative Syntax**: Uses Swift's powerful type system and attributes for intuitive AI configuration
4. **Tool Ecosystem**: Extensible architecture allowing custom AI capabilities
5. **Privacy-Focused**: Designed with Apple's privacy principles at its core

## üöÄ Quick Start

```swift
import FoundationModels

// Create a language model session
let session = LanguageModelSession(
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant"
)

// Generate streaming text
let stream = session.streamResponse(to: "Write a haiku about Swift")
for try await partial in stream {
    print(partial)
}
```

## üì± Example Applications

This documentation is based on real-world examples from Apple's sample projects:

- **HelloWorld** - Text summarization with streaming updates
- **SwiftExams** - Structured exam generation and grading
- **Travel** - AI-powered itinerary planning with external tools
- **Yummy** - Recipe recommendations with API integration
- **Jokes** - Simple content generation with tool usage

## ü§ù Contributing

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- Use `session.prewarm()` for faster initial responses
- Implement proper error handling for production apps
- Leverage `@Observable` for efficient SwiftUI updates
- Use structured generation for type-safe outputs

## üîí Privacy & Security

Foundation Models is designed with privacy at its core:
- On-device processing by default
- No data collection without explicit consent
- Full control over external API calls
- Transparent tool usage logging
